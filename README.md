# Jekyll static site scaffold with Sass and CoffeeScript

This repos contains a light-weight setup I use for building static sites. It is
built upon the wonderful [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and supports
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

When you wan't to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, run `./bin/release`
